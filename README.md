$def a(x) std::cout << x

#Basic

#Type specifed with the formula: *var* as *type* = *intialize_val*; 

str_ha = 'string'           #When there is no colon expected, the parser intended it's one line only. Any statement expect comment will be marked as error
is_true = 2 <> 5.4;   #When there is colon, many statements can be inserted. Statements after a comment will be considered as comments

func max with a as int, b as int: int;

	if a > b 
	bg
		ret a;
	end
	elif b > a
	bg
